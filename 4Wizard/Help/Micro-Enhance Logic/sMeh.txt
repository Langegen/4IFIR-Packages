Experimental settings that provide additional performance

sMeh1-5
allow, without affecting stability, in certain combinations of timings, eBALs and frequencies, where 4IFIR was not included algorithmically with 100% arbitration timings by memory controllers, to adjust them manually.

sMeh6 
By setting the value to 1, you can get an additional increase in power.

sMeh13
CPU priority. Reduces performance by one megahertz for the GPU, in favor of the CPU.
